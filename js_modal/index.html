                <p>Then we'll go with that data file! Pansy. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. You don't know how to do any of those.</p>
                <p>And I'm his friend Jesus. Do a flip! Who am I making this out to? Bender, being God isn't easy. <strong> If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope.</strong> <em> You have to use a light touch.</em> Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
                <h2>And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</h2>
                <p>Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! No, she'll probably make me do it. Bender, quit destroying the universe!</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…</li><li>Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</li><li>But I've never been to the moon!</li>
                </ol>

                <input type="text">

                <h3>Oh yeah, good luck with that.</h3>
                <p>Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Can we have Bender Burgers again? It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shut up and take my money!</li>
                    <li>Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!</li>
                    <li>Do a flip!</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We don't have a brig. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.</p>
                <p>I can explain. It's very valuable. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Oh yeah, good luck with that. Moving along…</p>
                <p>It's a T. It goes "tuh". Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.</p>
                <p>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Soothe us with sweet lies. Why not indeed! Bender, quit destroying the universe! And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.</p>
                <p>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! No! Don't jump! Ooh, name it after me! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? You're going to do his laundry?</p>
                <p>Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. But I've never been to the moon! Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</p>
                <p>My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>
                <p>Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… Bender, you risked your life to save me!</p>
                <p>No! Don't jump! We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</p>
                <p>You know, I was God once. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?</p>
                <p>All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? One hundred dollars. Leela's gonna kill me.</p>
